## Background
The purpose of this project was to build multiple machine learning models and compare them to identify the best model for classifying candidate exoplanets from the data provided by NASA.

## Requirements
* Compare the accuracy of at least 2 different Sci-Kit Machine Learning.
* Models Used:
  * Locgical Regression
  * Random Forest
  * KNN
  * SVM
  * Deep Learning
